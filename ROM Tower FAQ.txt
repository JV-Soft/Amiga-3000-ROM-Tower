ROM Tower is intended for installation in early revisions of the Amiga 3000,
in which there was an error in the PCB layout, and standard kickstart microcircuits cannot work there.

This adapter supports both standard ROM and ROM flashed in 27C400 chips. If you write ROM into 27C400 chips,
then you can get two kickstarts that will switch, to do this, you need to sequentially flash two parts of the kickstart versions you need,
which have a size of 256kb, into the HI and LO chips. Example 3.1 HI (256kb) 3.9 HI (256kb) and also 3.1 LO (256kb) 3.9 LO (256kb),
then connect a switch or jumper to the connector on the board and switch between these two versions.
